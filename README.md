Besides a beautiful, mobile-friendly implementation of Tetris, this project is a playground for
integrating and experimenting with web technologies.

In this repo you will find:

- A React/Redux architecture
- A [React Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) integration with create-react-app and Redux
- A [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) with offline support
